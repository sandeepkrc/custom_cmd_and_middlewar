# Django Custom Commands and Middleware

This section provides instructions on how to create a custom Django management command and custom middleware for your project.

## 1. Custom Django Management Command

A custom management command in Django allows you to extend the capabilities of the `manage.py` script by adding your own commands.

### Steps to Create a Custom Command

1. **Create a management folder**:
   In one of your Django apps, create a directory structure like this:

yourapp/ ├── management/ │ ├── init.py │ ├── commands/ │ ├── init.py │ └── your_command.py

2. **Write the command code**:
Inside `your_command.py`, write your custom command by subclassing `BaseCommand` from `django.core.management.base`:

```python

3.Run your command: Once the custom command is created, you can run it using:
python manage.py your_command arg1 --option



### Explanation of Key Steps:

- **For Custom Commands**:
  - Django looks for custom commands in the `management/commands` directory within each app.
  - The command class must subclass `BaseCommand` and implement the `handle()` method to perform actions.
  - You can add custom arguments to your command using `add_arguments()`.

- **For Middleware**:
  - Middleware is a callable class that processes a request and modifies the response.
  - Middleware must be added to the `MIDDLEWARE` list in `settings.py` for it to be executed during the request-response cycle.

### Example Use Cases:
- A **custom command** might be used to clean up old database records or send scheduled emails.
- A **custom middleware** can be used to track performance, log request data, or modify headers for security purposes.

This `README.md` section helps users understand how to extend Django with custom commands and middleware effectively.
